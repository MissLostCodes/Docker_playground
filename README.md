Learning Docker

### Docker is a tool that lets you package an application and everything it needs (code, libraries, dependencies, settings) into a single unit called a container.
A container can run on any computer that has Docker installed, so your app will work the same everywhere — no “it works on my machine” problem.
In short:   **Docker = box for your app + all its stuff → runs anywhere the same way.**

Docker Images : Executable files  -> Instructions To Build Containers 

Docker Hub : Somewhat like Github but for Docker -> Collection of docker images 

We can create multiple containers from one docker image .

Command to See All our images :   docker images 

docker pull image_name 

docker run image_name -> converts image to container
